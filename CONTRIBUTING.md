# Contributing

When contributing larger changes to this repository, please first discuss the changes you wish to make
via [an issue](https://github.com/xenyria/xenon/issues) for straight-forward changes
or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xenyria/xenon/discussions) for more complex changes before making a pull request.

## Scope of Contributions

This project is primarily developed for use on the **Xenyria Minecraft server**.  
While the code is open source and others are welcome to use or adapt it, I will generally only accept contributions that:

- Are useful or necessary for the Xenyria server, or
- Improve the quality of the existing codebase (bugfixes, performance improvements, refactoring, documentation).

Features that are not relevant to Xenyria are unlikely to be merged, since I do not want to maintain code that I cannot test or that isn’t used on my server.

If you’d like to add functionality outside of this scope, you are encouraged to **fork the project** and adapt it for your needs.
