# Xenon

---

This repository contains the official Fabric mod for the Xenyria Minecraft Server.

You can join our Server on `play.xenyria.net`.

## Features

- Adds a custom Discord Rich Presence to the game.
- Adds improved shooting detection & camera switching for PaintSquad.
- Level editor functionality (Debug shape rendering, Gizmos to manipulate translation, scale and rotation of game objects).

Although this mod is mainly focused on improving the experience on the Xenyria server, it can also be used on other servers.

## Project Structure

- `Core`: Contains shared code that is used by both the client and server. (packets, utilities & common logic)
- `Mod`: Contains client-specific code, such as rendering and input handling.
